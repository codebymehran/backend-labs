The CPU, or central processing unit, is often referred to as the brain of the computer. It handles instructions from programs and processes data, making it essential for overall performance.

Modern CPUs come with multiple cores, allowing them to perform several tasks simultaneously. This multi-core architecture boosts efficiency, especially for multitasking and demanding applications.

Clock speed is another key factor, measured in gigahertz (GHz). A higher clock speed generally means faster processing, but other factors like architecture and cache size also play a significant role.

Cooling solutions are crucial for maintaining optimal CPU performance. Overheating can lead to throttling, which slows down processing speeds. Proper cooling ensures longevity and reliability.
